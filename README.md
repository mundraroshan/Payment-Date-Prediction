## Payment-Date-Prediction
### ML PROJECT


We are going to use many python libraries in this payment date prediction project like  pandas , numpy , Seaborn , Sklearn etc. to  extract insights from our data and apply machine learning concepts.

We are going to divide our dataset's data in to train and test set to check the accuracy of our model.

And in the end we are going to predict the payment date and catagorize them into buckets to predict for our delay using machine learning algorithms.

We are using Random Forest for training and tuning our machine learning model.


## Attributes used in the dataset.

Business Code, Customer Number, Customer Name, Clear Date, Business Year, Doc Id, Posting Date, Due In Date, Document Create Date, Invoice Currency, Document Type, Posting ID, Area Business, Baseline Create Date, Total Open Amount, Customer Payment Terms, Invoice ID.
